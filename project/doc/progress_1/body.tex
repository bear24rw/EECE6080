\section{Pinout Diagram}

The pinout diagram for INTRANEX is shown below in Figure~\ref{fig:pinout}.
Pins that are currently unutilized will be assigned to various internal logic
signals once the floorplan is finalized. Note the symmetry of the core
functionality.  This was done so that multiple INTRANEX chip can be directly
chained together with minimal routing effort during PCB layout.

\section{Chip Functionality}

The major function of this chip is to take an N bit input and translate any bit
position to any other position. This allows for commonly desired functionality
such as bit reversing or nibble swapping. To accomplish this we use a N by N
bit interconnect network known as the PIN (Programmable Interconnect Network).
The PIN is configured to perform the desired bit mappings by clocking in the
mappings using the \texttt{PSI} (PIN Shift Input) and \texttt{PCLKI} (PIN Clock
Input) pins.  The value to be manipulated, called  the Input Value, Shift Value
or Shifter Value, is then clocked in serially using the \texttt{SI} (Shifter
Input) and \texttt{SCLKI} (Shifter Clock Input) pins. To obtain the result the
\texttt{LDI} (Load Input) pin is pulled high and the \texttt{SCLKI} pin is
pulsed to latch the result in to the shift register. Once the result is latched
the \texttt{LDI} pin is de-asserted and the result can be clocked out of the
\texttt{SO} (Shifter Output) pin. Note that the input value is clocked in MSB
first and the output value is clocked out MSB first as well.

\subsection{Configuring the Programmable Interconnect Network}

A timing diagram illustrating the PIN configuration process for a 3-Bit
INTRANEX is shown below. For a 3-Bit input value a 3x3 grid is required
resulting in a PIN configuration vector of 9 Bits. The mapping for each of
these bits is also labeled and will be explained further in later sections.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../waveforms/pin.png}
    \caption{PIN Configuration}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Loading and reading a value}

Loading an input value is achieved by clocking the value in on the \texttt{SI}
pin using the \texttt{SCLKI} pin. The \texttt{LDI} pin must be held low during
this operation. The diagram below illustrates this process and shows the bit
definitions of the value being clocked in.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../waveforms/shift_load.png}
    \caption{Loading a value}
\end{figure}

After the value has been loaded in the result is clocked out in a similar
fashion. To first latch the result the \texttt{LDI} pin needs to be held high
and the \texttt{SCLKI} pin pulsed. The MSB of the result is now available on
the \texttt{SO} pin. The \texttt{LDI} pin should now be held low while clocking out
the remaining result bits.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../waveforms/shift_load_read.png}
    \caption{Loading a value and reading the result}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Test Mode}

Test Mode is enabled by pulling the \texttt{TESTI} pin high. When this occurs
the output of the internal input value shift register is rerouted to connect to
the input of the PIN network bypassing its normal \texttt{PSI} input.
Additionally the \texttt{SCLKO} signal is also routed to the PIN bypassing its
normal \texttt{PCLKI} signal. Finally the \texttt{PSO} signal is routed to the
\texttt{SO} pin. This allows values that are clocked in via the \texttt{SI} pin
to propagate through the shifter and then through the PIN and then out the
\texttt{SO} pin. The fact that the values come out the \texttt{SO} pin allows
multiple INTRANEX chips to be directly chained and tested in circuit using only
the \texttt{SI} and \texttt{SCLKI} pins of the first chip in the chain. Note
that the \texttt{LDI} pin must be held low during this entire operation in
order to ensure proper shifting through the input value shift register.

\section{Design Decisions}

When evaluating design concepts and possible solutions we prioritized a few key
factors that we wanted to achieve. The first is a fully bit-sliced solution
where each slice can directly connect to the next with minimal wiring overhead
and zero additional logic. This will allow us to utilize Magics \texttt{Array}
functionality to quickly build up our chip and allow us to easily scale to any
desired size. As we see in later sections we were able to achieve a fully
bit-sliced design with zero logic overhead.

In order to achieve totally minimized wiring overhead it would be necessary to
design two different slice layouts, one of which is mirrored and flipped. This
would allow each slice row in the PIN to share a power rail with the rows above
and below it and also minimize the length of the row-to-row wiring. This design
however greatly increases the complexity of the VHDL design as wiring the rows
together becomes trickier. Additionally we would have to maintain two different
versions of the PIN slices. We decided to instead go with a design where all
slices are exactly identical and the interconnect between them is linear. This
allows for easier calculation of PIN configuration values as every row has the
same index order.  The only real disadvantage to this design is that we will
require long interconnects between slices. We are assuming for now that even
with the added capacitance of these long interconnects we will still be able to
achieve max clock speeds of greater than 50Mhz. By progress report 2 we will
have layout simulation results to confirm this.

As stated earlier an important goal for us was to be able to directly chain
multiple INTRANEX chips together. Our current design achieves this and an
example chain showing 3 INTRANEXs chained together is shown below. Note that
the pin layout in this diagram matches that of the actual layout we plan on
implementing.

\section{Block Diagrams}

    \subsection{Top Level}
    A top level block diagram for a 3-bit INTRANEX is shown below. The top
    module is the PIN and the bottom module is the parallel load shift
    register. Test mode logic has been excluded to more clearly illustrate the
    core functionality.

        \caption{Top Level Block Diagram (3-Bit Configuration)}
        \label{fig:block}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Top Level With Test Mode }
    The same top level diagram is shown with the addition of the test
    mode logic. The test mode logic simply consists of 3 2:1 multiplexers that
    redirect the output of the shift register to the input of the PIN and the
    output of the PIN to what is normally the output of the shift register. In
    other words, it wires in the PIN between the shifter and the shifters
    normal output pins.

        \caption{Top Level Block Diagram Showing Test Mode Logic (3-Bit Configuration)}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Top Level Bit Sliced}
    The diagram below shows a bit sliced version of the top level diagram shown
    in Figure~\ref{fig:block}. We can see how each slice is directly connected
    together with zero interfacing logic as well as the long row-to-row
    connections as discussed earlier.

    \end{figure}

    \newpage
    \subsection{Parallel Load Shift Register}

        \subsubsection{Bit-slicing Scheme}
        Looking at just the shift register we can see that it is a parallel
        load parallel output shifter that is easily extendable by simply
        tacking on additional slices.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../logisim/shift.png}
            \caption{Parallel Load Bit-Sliced Shifter Register (3-Bit Configuration)}
        \end{figure}

        \subsubsection{Bit-Slice}
        Looking at the internals of a single shift slice we can see that is is
        just a 2:1 multiplexer and a D Flip Flop. The multiplexer determines if
        the slice should load either the value from the previous slice
        (\texttt{SI}) or the parallel input (\texttt{Z}). When \texttt{LDI} is
        0 it uses the value of the previous slice and when it is a 1 it uses
        the parallel load value.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../logisim/shift_slice.png}
            \caption{Parallel Load Shifter Register Bit-Slice}
        \end{figure}

    \newpage
    \subsection{Programmable Interconnect Network}

        \subsubsection{Bit-slicing Scheme}
        The diagram below showns just the PIN in bit-slice form. One of the
        design decisions made while determining the slice interconnects was to
        also pass the \texttt{PCLK} from slice to slice. The alternative was to
        simply connect each slices \texttt{PCLKI} to the main \texttt{PCLKI}
        pin at a higher level. We wanted to avoid as much manual layout as
        possible so it determined to be easier and cleaner to route the clock
        in such as way that it would be automatically connected when we layout
        the slice array.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../../logisim/pin.png}
            \caption{Bit-Sliced Programmable Interconnect Network (3-Bit Configuration)}
        \end{figure}

        \subsubsection{Bit-Slice}
        The PIN bit-slices, one of which is shown below, is what drive the
        whole functionality of our chip. \texttt{WI} is the input values bit
        for the current column. If that bit is set and this slice is configured
        as `connected' we want to output a logic high on the \texttt{Z} bus
        simultaneously. We cannot, however, just simply \texttt{AND} these two
        values together and attach it to the bus as this would allow for
        multiple slices to drive or sink the bus. To avoid this we use an
        \texttt{OR} gate to determine if the slice behind us is outputting a 1.
        If so we just pass it along.  If we want to output a 1 it is also no
        problem as the \texttt{OR} will accommodate us as well.

\section{VHDL Test Bench Results}
    \subsection{Top Level Functional}
        While our top level functional testbench is completely automated and
        does an exhaustive test on all possible inputs an example waveform is
        shown below. We can first see that we clock in a PIN configuration
        vector of \texttt{000001000} which enables slice \texttt{Z1W2}. We then
        shift in a value of \texttt{001}. Given these input vectors we expect
        the output vector to be \texttt{010}. We can see from the waveform
        below that we achieve the expected result.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../doc/vhdl_sim_pics/top.png}
            \caption{Top Level Functional Test Bench Waveform}
        \end{figure}
    \subsection{Top Level Test Mode}
        Our top level test mode testbench is also completely automated. For
        this test we simply send a pulse through all the flip flops and count
        the number of clock cycles it takes for the pulse to come out the other
        end. For a 3-Bit configuration there are 3*3+3 flip flops so we expect
        the pulse to appear at the output after 12 clock pulses. We can see
        from the waveform below that we achieve the expected output.
